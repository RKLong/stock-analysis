# stock-analysis
**Challenge 2 - VBA UCB Bootcamp**


# Overview of the Project
The workbook was initially created for Steve to analyze the stocks his parents were interested in investing on, but then since it was also possible to expand the data set to include other stocks that have been performing better than the ones his parents were interested in.

We were also given the task to refactor the initial code(All Stocks Analysis) we worked  on to test or determine whether the refactored code (AllStocksAnalysisRefactored) would run more efficient than the initial code. 

# Results

## DQ Stock 
Although Steve’s parents have very admirable intentions for wanting to invest in DQ stocks, which is a green company, it might not be a good idea for a short term investment (meaning if they want to sell their stocks immediately) Although DQ performed very well in 2017; Of the 12 companies included in the list it was traded the least, in terms of Daily Volume, but it had the highest returns. For 2018, It’s Total Daily Volume has increased three time, but it’s investors suffered loses.

## Alternative Companies to Invest In
ENPH and RUN are stocks that seem to be doing well. Of the 12 companies included in the list, The two were the only companies with positive returns in 2018, with RUN having a positive increase in its returns, while ENPH’s returns were lower than its returns from 2017, it still  performed better than the other companies.

## ObservationS based on the Data
Although Total Daily Volume may be a good indicator of a stock’s performance, I tried looking at the returns and sorted/filtered them in order vis a vis the Total Daily Volume should not be the only factor in choosing what company to invest on. A majority of the stocks in 2018 had an increase in their Total Daily Volume, but suffered massive losses.

Other factors outside of the company’s control may have to be considered ,such as how a competitor’s stocks is doing, trends in what people are investing on, people’s changing habits, natural calamities, a pandemic and many other factors. Steve and his parents may want to do more research on the company they want to invest on and decide whether they want to make safe, long term investments or high risk, high yield, short-term investments.  

## Execution Times of the Original Script and the Refactored Script

In my case, the original script ran faster than the refactored script for both years.

# Summary

Refactoring Code was actually a good exercise in problem-solving, in terms of trying to look for a different pathway(s) or solution(s) to the same problem. If there is one disadvantage about refactoring code it is that I found it a bit time consuming, however I am very much aware that even if it is time consuming, it might be worth it in the long run.
 
As a person who is new at studying this field it made me more aware of what I was doing, constantly proofreading and going back and forth between both codes. It also made me aware of who might be the possible audience reading and using my code/
